CRK is a small utility to (en/de)crypt any type of file with a key using the XOR method, it is written in Python3.



To run CRK you may use : python3 main.py input_file_path output_file_path key OR pypy3 main.py input_file_path output_file_path key



You should use PyPy3, you'll get much better performance !
